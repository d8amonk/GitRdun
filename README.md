###GitRdun

## Purpose:
A repo to store useful R scripts away from the cookie jar that is my Google Drive.

## Direction:
I'd like this to eventually become the repo for all of my R code, so that I might be able to run scripts remotely.

## Motivation:
I'd like to keep original copies and their various views/flavors separate from "working copies" in my cloud and local save locations.  Thinking of this as a `clnRchive`.
